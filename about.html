        <h3>About the Memory Game</h3>
        <p>
            Memory is a classic card game that tests a player's ability to remember the location of matching pairs of cards. The game is usually played with a deck of cards that are laid out face down on a table or playing surface. Players take turns flipping over two cards at a time, trying to find a matching pair. If they find a match, they keep the cards and get another turn. If they don't find a match, they turn the cards back over and it becomes the next player's turn. The game continues until all the cards have been matched. The player with the most matched pairs at the end of the game is the winner. Memory is a simple and enjoyable game that can be played by people of all ages, and it's a great way to improve your memory and concentration skills.
